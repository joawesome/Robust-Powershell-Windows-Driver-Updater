# Robust-Powershell-Windows-Driver-Updater
This is a more "error free" approach for using windows updates to install missing drivers on fresh new windows installs.

This was inspired by @[SapphSky](https://github.com/SapphSky)'s driver update script in his win.refurb.sh repository, as we use it for our company to make driver installation efficent.
